Hey,

Throughout the course, I'll be pointing you towards skeleton projects, awesome tools, links, resources and background reading that help you learn web development. I've collated all of them together grouped by module, so you can easily find them.



Head over to the link below and **bookmark it**, so whenever you need a link you'll be able to refer to the list.
